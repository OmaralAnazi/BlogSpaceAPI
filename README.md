# BlogSpace

## Description
"BlogSpace" is a guided project from the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program that simulates a blogging platform. The site features a few dummy blogs fetched from an API, and it allows users to contribute by posting new blog entries with titles and bodies.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Utilized HTTP request methods, including GET to retrieve blog posts and POST to submit new ones.
- Managed URL endpoints and parameters for API calls.
- Handled the request body for POST operations to submit blog data.
- Customized HTTP headers to ensure correct handling of requests and responses.
- Explored RESTful service architecture to understand how client-server communications work.

## Setup
Clone the repository and open `index.html` to view and interact with the blog posts or submit a new one.
